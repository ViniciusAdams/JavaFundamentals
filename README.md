Exercise 1--
Your challenge is to create four new variables:
A byte variable, set it to any valid byte number, it doesn't matter.
A short variable, set it to any valid short number.
An int variable,  set it to any valid integer number.
Lastly, create a variable of type long. Make it equal to 50,000 plus 10 times the sum of the values of the first 3 variables (your byte, your short and your int values).  In other words, use the variable names in your expression to calculate the sum.

Exercise 2--
Insert a code segment after the code we've just reviewed:
Set the existing score variable to 10,000.
Set the existing levelCompleted variable to 8.
Set the existing bonus variable to 200.
Use the same if condition (meaning if gameOver is true) you want to perform the same calculation, and print out the value of the finalScore variable.
